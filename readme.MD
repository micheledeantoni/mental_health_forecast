# Forecasting Depression Rates with PyTorch (WIP)

This repository is my playground for exploring depression rate forecasting using ✨PyTorch✨! It's my first dive into this powerful tool, and I'm using it to learn more about time-series analysis and deep learning applications.

## Project Goal
To build a model that can predict future depression rates by considering other factors like anxiety, eating disorders, and alcohol disorders.

## Dataset
[Uncover global trends in mental health disorder](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder)

## Model & Results
This is still a work in progress, but my current PyTorch model shows promising results! The Mean Squared Error (MSE) for predicting 2017 depression rates is around 0.4, which is pretty good!

## Limitations
- The model uses data from 2017, so it might not be super accurate for current trends.
- There's room for improvement by trying different models and techniques. ️

## Next Steps
- Experiment with more advanced time-series models and architectures.
- Find newer datasets to get more up-to-date predictions.
- Polish the project and write better documentation (like this readme!).

## Disclaimer
This is just a personal learning project to explore PyTorch for forecasting. Don't use these results in the real world without further testing and development! ⚠️
